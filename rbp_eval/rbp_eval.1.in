.SH NAME
rbp_eval \- calculate rank-biased precision for a retrieval run

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rbp_eval 
[OPTION]\|.\|.\|.\|
.I qrels\-file run\-file
.br
.B rbp_eval -h

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B rbp_eval
calculates the
.I rank-biased precision
of the retrieval run given in 
.I run\-file
against the relevance judgments provided by
.I qrels-file\|.
It is intended as a drop-in replacement for
.BR trec_eval (1).  
The
.I rbp
metric itself is not described in this man page, see the 
.B REFERENCES
section for more information.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 
.BI "\-d " "DEPTH_SPEC"
Calculate 
.I rbp 
to the specified depth in the run. 
.I DEPTH_SPEC
may be a single non-negative integer, or it may be a comma-separated 
list of integers (in increasing order, 
without spaces).  In the latter case
.I rbp
will be calculated and reported at each of these depths.
.I 0
indicates to calculate for all documents in the run; this is the default.
If in a list of depths, 
.I 0 
should be specified at the end.  If multiple depths are specified, a
column will be added to the output specifying to which depth each
.I rbp 
value has been calculated.  The default depth specification is
.I 0
(calculate exhaustively).

.TP
.BI "\-p " "PERSIST_SPEC"
Use the specified user persistence 
.RI "(" "p"
in the
.I rbp
formulation) to calculate
.IR "rbp" "."
This may be a single value in the range [0.0, 1.0], or it may be
a comma-separated list of such values (without spaces).  If a
list of
.I p
values is specified, a column will be added to the output specifying
which
.I p
value each 
.I rbp
value has been calculated using.  The default persistence specification
is
.IR "0.5,0.8,0.95" "."

.TP
.BI "\-q"
Report results for each query, in addition to results across the entire
run.  The default is to only report overall results.

.TP
.BI "\-r"
Rank documents in the run by the rankings given in column 4 of
.IR "run-file" "."
Two documents with the same ranking will be considered ties;
see
.B TIES
below for a description of tie handling.  The default is to rank
documents by order of occurence in
.IR "run-file" ","
in which case ties are not possible.

.TP
.BI "\-s"
Rank documents in the run by the scores given in column 5 of
.IR "run-file" ","
rather than by order of occurence.
Two documents with the same ranking will be considered ties;
see
.BI TIES
below for a description of tie handling.
.B -s
and
.B -r
are mutually exclusive.

.TP
.BI "\-b " "THRESHOLD"
Convert relevance judgments in column 6 of
.I run-file
to binary (0 or 1) at threshold
.I THRESHOLD
(with the threshold value mapping to 1).

.TP
.BI "\-B"
Convert relevance judgments to binary at threshold
.IR "1.0" "."

.TP
.BI "\-f " "SCALE"
Multiply relevance judgments in column 6 of
.I "run-file"
by
.IR "SCALE"
without collapsing them to binary judgments.

.TP
.I "\-F"
Use relevance judgments in column 6 of
.I "run-file"
as-is, without collapsing them to binary judgments.

.TP
.I "\-a"
Automatically determine the way in which relevance judgments in column
6 of
.I "run-file"
should be handled.  If only integral relevances are found, they will
be treated as binary at threshold 
.I 1
(equivalent to the
.I \-B
option).  If relevances contain decimal places (even if they are all
just ".0"), treat them as fractional relevances without scaling (as with the
.I \-F
option).  This is the default handling of relevance judgments.  Options
.IR \-B ", " \-b ", " -F ", " \-f ", and " \-a
are mutually exclusive.

.TP
.I "\-H"
Suppress the header in the output.  See
.B OUTPUT FORMAT
below.

.TP
.I "\-h"
Print a help message and exit.

.SH QRELS FILE FORMAT

The
.I qrels-file
must contain exactly four space-separated columns.  The columns
are:

.IP 
.I qid iter docid rel
.PP

The format and meaning of each column is as follows:

.TP
.I qid
The id of the query the relevance judgment is for.  This can be any string,
although there is currently no mechanism for embedding spaces within
a qid.  The qid of the judgment is matched against the qid held in the
first column of the
.I run-file
(see below); the matching is not case sensitive (to be precise, qids from
both the
.I qrels-file
and the
.I run-file
are folded to lower case).

.TP
.I iter
This field is ignored.

.TP
.I docid
The id of the document.  This can be any string, although there is currently
no mechanism for embedding spaces.  The docids of the judgments are matched
against the docids of the
.I run-file
in a non case-sensitive way (to be precise, docids from obth files are
folded to lower case).

.TP
.I rel
The judged relevance of document
.I docid
to query
.IR qid "."
This field can be any non-negative number, either integral or with
decimal places.  See the
.IR \-b ", " \-B ", " \-f ", " \-F ", and " \-a
options for different ways of treating these relevance values.

.PP

Judgments in the qrels file can come in any order; all judgments for
a given 
.I qid
do not need to be in sequence, nor do they need to be ordered by
.IR docid "."

.SH RUN FILE FORMAT

The
.I run-file
must contain exactly six space-separated columns.  The columns
are:

.IP 
.I qid iter docid rank score runid
.PP

The format and meaning of each column is as follows:

.TP
.I qid
The id of the query.  See under
.B QRELS FILE FORMAT
above.

.TP
.I iter
This field is ignored.

.TP
.I docid
The id of the document.  See under
.B QRELS FILE FORMAT
above.

.TP
.I rank
A non-negative integer giving
the rank of the document in the list of answers to the
specified query.  If the
.I \-r
option is in effect, this field is used to order the document
results for each query, and if two or more documents have the
same rank, they will be treated as ties.  No check is made to
ensure that the rankings are strictly sequential.  If the
.I \-r
option is not specified, this field is ignored.

.TP
.I score
A floating-point value giving this document's similarity score for 
the specified query.  If the
.I \-s
option is in effect, this fields is used to order the document
results for each query, and if two or more documents have the
same score, they will be treated as ties.  If the
.I \-s
option is not specified, this field is ignored.

.TP
.I runid
An arbitrary string identifying this run.  A warning will be issued
if the same run id is not used for each entry, but otherwise the
field is ignored.

.PP
Entries in the run file can be in any order; results for a given
query do not have to be in sequence.  If per-query figures
are to be reported (the
.I \-q
option), then queries are reported in the order of their first
occurence.  If ordering by rank (option
.IR \-r ")"
or score (option
.IR \-r ")"
is not specified, then answers to a particular query will be
ordered by occurence within the run file.

.SH OUTPUT FORMAT

The output of
.I rbp_eval
consists of one line for each combination of depth and persistence.
If the 
.I \-q
option is specified, then scores are reported for each query,
as well as overall averages across the run; otherwise, only
the averages are printed.

Each line of the output consists of nine space-separated fields,
as follows:

.IP
.RB p= " persist " q= " qid " d= " depth " rbp= "rbp " + "err"

.PP
The 
.I qid
field is "all"  for the averages; the
.I depth
field is "full" for full evaluation.

At the start of the output, several header lines will be printed,
reporting information on the 
.I rbp_eval
run, such as the command-line arguments used, the date of the
run, and so forth.  Each line of the header begins with
the character '#'.  The header may be suppressed with the
.I \-H
option.

.PP

.SH TIES
The way in which
.I rbp_eval
calculates the
.I rbp
metric is in the general case a straightforward application of
the formulae presented in the rbp paper.  However, using the
.I \-r
or
.I \-s
arguments to specify a document ranking other than occurence order
introduces the possibility of tied rankings when documents have
the same score 
.RI "(" \-s ")"
or provided rank
.RI "(" \-r ")."

Tied results are handled by giving each document in the tie the average
weight of the positions covered by the tie.  Assume that documents
.IR d9 ", " d10 ", and " d11 
are tied at position 9.  Let the weights for positions
9 through 11 be 
.IR w9 ", " w10 ", and " w11 
respectively.  Then each of 
.IR d9 ", " d10 ", and " d11 
will be given the weight 
.RI "(" w9 " + " w10 " + " w11  ")"
/ 3.

Handling of ties is complicated further if a cutoff depth less
than the actual number of results is specified using the
.I \-d
option, and the tied results happen to span the specified cutoff depth.
Returning to the previous example of a documents
.IR d9 ", " d10 ", and " d11 
being tied at position 9, assume that a cutoff depth of 10 has been
set for 
.I rbp
evaluation.  Two-thirds of the span of positions 9 through 11 fit within
the cutoff limit.  Therefore, each of the documents tied at position
9 is considered to be two-thirds within the cutoff limit, and so
are assigned two-thirds of the averaged weight as calculated above,
in other words,
.RI "(2 * (" w9 " + " w10 " + " w11  "))" 
/ 9.  Note that the residual error bound is still set at 
.I p
to the power 10, since in order to maintain consistency of results,
the one third of documents
.IR d9 ", " d10 ", and " d11 
that fall outside the depth cutoff are treated as unknown.

The effect of handling ties across the cutoff depth in the way
described above is to calculate the average of the figures resulting
from each possible combination of tied documents selected to include
within the cutoff.  The
.I rbp
values calculated to depth
.I d
can therefore differ from what would be given
by sorting the documents and extracting the top
.I d
rankings.

.SH WARNINGS AND ERRORS

The following conditions will cause
.I rbp_eval
to report an error and abort processing:

.IP 
* The 
.I qrels-file
or
.I run-file
are not in the format specified above.

.IP 
* The qrels file contains multiple entries for the one 
.RI "(" qid ", " docid ")"
pair (even if the relevance value is the same).

.PP
The following conditions will cause
.I rbp_eval
to print a warning, but continue processing:

.IP
* The run file contains results for a query for which there are no
judgments in the qrels file.

.IP
* Non-binary relevance judgments are in use, and the maximum effective
judged relevance is greater than 1.0.

.IP
* The 
.I runid
field of the run file (see 
.B "RUN FILE FORMAT"
above) does not always contain the same value.
